# react-redux-saga-boilerplate

My simple starter kit which I'd love to share to the community. The project was generated from `create-react-app` and then I included a few libraries.

## Features Out-Of-The-Box

* React-Router 4
* Semantic Ui
* Redux
* Redux Saga
* ESlint
* Airbnb's ESlint rules

## Live Demo
